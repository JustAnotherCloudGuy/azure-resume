## Why I did This Project

I chose this project because it provided the opportunity to learn through trial and error with different Azure services and programming/DevOps tools. 

## Challenges Faced
A big aspect of learning I gained from this project was deep troubleshooting of issues. For example, one challenge that happened often was fixing errors in my code caused by missing packages/dependencies. Another challenge was that I accidentally made changes directly to my GitHub repo instead of locally, which blocked me from pushing code from my local machine.

## Future Improvements 

I've included these in the [issues](https://github.com/JustAnotherCloudGuy/azure-resume/issues) section of my repo
