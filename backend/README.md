## Security Concerns

Move a [gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) from another directory to the backend/tests folder which isn't made by default so you don't commit your Cosmos DB key to your GitHub account. If you do commit secrets rotate your Cosmos DB keys via your cloud provider.
